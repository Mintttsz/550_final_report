## Project contents

  I report the summary table of total COVID-19 cases in 2022 stratified by several regions per month. And including a plot showing the trend of new cases over time.
  The report is generated by several R scripts and a Rmarkdown file. Makefile is available also.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Upadate using docker

`Dockerfile`

  - builds an image that can be used to create my final report.
  - link to the image on DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/mengkedu/report

Instruction to build the final report locally

  - forks and clones
  - navigates to project directory
  - runs `make project_image` to build the docker image, it would take some time.
  - runs `report/project_md.html` to run the docker container. Once finish, the final report would be in the `report` folder.

Instruction to build the final report by pulling image from Docker Hub

  - use link above
  - run `docker pull mengkedu/report`
  - run `docker run -it mengkedu/report`
  - Final report creates.

My target will build appropriately on Windows system
